# Jar-viz Before time began, there was the Cube. We know not where it comes from, only that it holds the power to create worlds and fill them with life. That is how our race was born.

I have witnessed their capacity for courage, and though we are worlds apart, like us there's more to them than meets the eye. I am Optimus Prime, and I send this message to any surviving autobots taking refuge among the stars: We are here. We are waiting.
